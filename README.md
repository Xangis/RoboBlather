RoboBlather
===========

A basic text-to-speech application for Windows.

A compiled version of this program with installer is available here:

This application was written using C# .NET 3.0 and should run on any system that
supports .NET 3.0. It has been tested on Windows XP, Vista, 7, and 8. A project is
included for Visual Studio 11. It doesn't have any complicated dependencies, so you
can create a project for an earlier version simply by including the source files.

An installer script for the Nullsoft Installer System (NSIS) is included, but you'll
probably have to modify the paths in order for it to work.
